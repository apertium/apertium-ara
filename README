Arabic

apertium-ara  
===

This is an Apertium monolingual language package for Arabic. What  
you can use this language package for:

-   Morphological analysis of Arabic
-   Morphological generation of Arabic
-   Part-of-speech tagging of Arabic

Requirements  
===

You will need the following software installed:

-   lttoolbox (&gt;= 3.3.0)
-   apertium (&gt;= 3.3.0)
-   vislcg3 (&gt;= 0.9.9.10297)

If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at:
apertium.org

Compiling  
===

Given the requirements being installed, you should be able to just run:

```
$ ./configure  
$ make
```

You can use `./autogen.sh` instead of `./configure` if you're compiling  
from SVN.

If you're doing development, you don't have to install the data, you  
can use it directly from this directory.

If you are installing this language package as a prerequisite for an  
Apertium translation pair, then do (typically as root / with sudo):

`make install`

You can give a --prefix to ./configure to install as a non-root user,  
but make sure to use the same prefix when installing the translation  
pair and any other language packages.

Testing  
===

If you are in the source directory after running make, the following  
commands should work:

`$ echo "TODO: test sentence" | apertium -d . ara-morph`
TODO: test analysis result

`$ echo "TODO: test sentence" | apertium -d . ara-tagger`
TODO: test tagger result
